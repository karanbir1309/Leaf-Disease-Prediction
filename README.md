# Leaf-Disease-Prediction
The leaf disease detection model is built using deep learning techniques, and it uses transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained knowledge of a base model. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of 33 different types of leaf diseases. For more information about the architecture, dataset, and training process, please refer to the code and documentation provided.
